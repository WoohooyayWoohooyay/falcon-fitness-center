<h1><b>-Hurricane Maria-</b></h1>
<p><b>When it started?:</b>September 16, 2017</p>
<p><b>Progress:</b> Moving westward to the south of a mid-level high pressure area, the cyclone strengthened into a tropical storm around 1800 UTC on 16 September.  Maria turned toward the west-northwest shortly thereafter, and quickly intensified into a hurricane by 1800 UTC on 17 September.  While situated in an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and light vertical shear, the hurricane strengthened extremely rapidly.  Maria became a 100-kt major hurricane by 1200 UTC 18 September, and just 12 h later, as it neared Dominica, it became a category 5 hurricane with maximum winds of 145 kt.  The hurricane made landfall on the island with that intensity and an estimated minimum central pressure of 922 mb around 0115 UTC 19 September. </p>
<p><b> Overall description:</b>Maria was a very severe Cape Verde Hurricane that ravaged the island of Dominica at category 5 (on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) intensity, and later devastated Puerto Rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane.</p>
<p> <b>Anything unique:</b>Hurricane Maria had some of the strongest 1-minute sustained winds for an Atlantic Hurricane in recorded history.</p>
<p> <b> Cities impacted: </b>

Puerto Rico,

United States,

Dominica,

Dominican Republic,

U.S. Virgin Islands,

and The Bahamas </p>
