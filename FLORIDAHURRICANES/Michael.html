<h1><b>-Hurricane Michael-</b></h1>
<p><b>When it started:</b> Oct. 10, 2018</p>
<p><b>How it progressed:</b> Michael subsequently accelerated east back out over the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened, into a powerful cyclone by October 14. On October 15, Michael ended its run by making landfall in Portugal early on October 16. Following landfall, what was left of Michael quickly weakened, dissipating later on the same day.</p>
<p><b>Overall Description:</b>Michael was a category 5 hurricane (on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale) that made a catastrophic landfall near Mexico Beach and Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, producing devastating winds and storm surge near the coast, and rain and wind inland. </p>
<p><b> Anything unique:</b>Hurricane Michael was truly a unique event. Since 1851, and prior to Hurricane Michael, only nine major hurricanes have made landfall over the Florida Panhandle (Figure 10). Michael, as it stands now, is the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.</p>
<p><b> Cities impacted:</b>This final wind intensity is a 5 knot (5 mph) increase over the operational estimate and makes Michael a category 5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale at the time of landfall on October 10, 2018, near Mexico Beach and Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. </p>
